For deploying galera, add "./inventory" file to specify the hosts as per your requirements. For example, I have added a host as 54.201.178.145 with its key.

1. Deploy package includes the following steps:
   a) Disable AppArmor
   b) Enable Codership repository
   c) Install galera-3, galera-arbitrator-3, mysql-wsrep-5.6, and python-mysqldb
   d) Configure swap space

   -- Commands used to run this play-list
	ansible-playbook  -v deploy_package.yaml -i inventory -u ubuntu

2. Apply configuration
        ansible-playbook  -v apply_config.yaml -i inventory -u ubuntu

3. Service start/stop.
   -- I have created service_state.yaml playlist to start/stop/status/restart mysql service, in this we have to define the operation as started/stopped/restarted/status and extra_arg as --wsrep-new-cluster/''.
      Master node:
	ansible-playbook -v service_state.yaml -i inventory -u ubuntu -e "operation=started extra_arg=--wsrep-new-cluster"
      Other nodes:
	ansible-playbook -v service_state.yaml -i inventory -u ubuntu -e "operation=started extra_arg=''"

	ansible-playbook -v service_state.yaml -i inventory -u ubuntu -e operation=stopped
	ansible-playbook -v service_state.yaml -i inventory -u ubuntu -e operation=restarted
	ansible-playbook -v service_state.yaml -i inventory -u ubuntu -e operation=status
