1. For deploying haproxy, modify "./inventory" file to specify the hosts as per your requirements. For example, I have added a host as 54.201.178.145 with its key.

2. Deploy haproxy
   -- use deploy-package.yaml playlist which executes the following steps on host node:
	1)sudo apt-get install haproxy
	2)set "ENABLED=1" in /etc/default/haproxy
        3)sudo update-rc.d haproxy defaults
   -- Commands used to run this play-list
	ansible-playbook -v deploy-package.yaml -i inventory -u ubuntu

3. Deploy and apply config
  	ansible-playbook -v apply-config.yaml -i inventory -u ubuntu
  
4. Service start/stop.
   -- I have created service-state.yaml playlist to start/stop/status/restart haproxy service, in this we have to define the operation as started/stopped/restarted/status:

	ansible-playbook -v service-state.yaml -i inventory -u ubuntu -e operation=started
	ansible-playbook -v service-state.yaml -i inventory -u ubuntu -e operation=stopped
	ansible-playbook -v service-state.yaml -i inventory -u ubuntu -e operation=restarted
	ansible-playbook -v service-state.yaml -i inventory -u ubuntu -e operation=status
